    <h2>November 29th, 20224</h2>
    <p>Happy not Thanksgiving everyone! Yesterday was super chaotic! How existential! One doesn't plan to have to face one's traumas and come out the other side rejuvenated.
        I'm so thankful that yesterday, I was able to accept a painful past situation and come out of it wiser.
    </p>
    <p>I thought I would start with it first because I want to keep a record. What I learned yesterday seems like a nugget of wisdom that must be preserved and communicated.
        I believe people who share the label of HSP also struggle with self-worth in a world with palpable differences in sensory perception. To put it shortly, being a human is a constant struggle,
        to hold back reactionary instincts and behave in a constructive manner.
    </p>
    <p>I'll close with a sample of the lesson I enlightened with yesterday, (wrote with "you" but more for myself, I know some people don't like to read those sort of statements,) 
        <b>"Your health is connected to the world around you. If you are unwell, if you perceive yourself has having less value than others,
        your relationships will be affected. People aren't better than you. You are as important, not anymore, not any less, than every other living thing in this world. 
        So please, love yourself. Face everyday with a smile, and strive to become a person whom you will not regret at the end."</b></p>
        <p>I'm considering renaming this page with journal/dairy or something that implies introspective content. It a semi-personal half-journal-half-diary loosely related to my projects.
            We'll see.
        </p>
    <h2>November 26th, 2024</h2>
    <p>Quick update because I didn't want to leave the previous one for long.</p> 
    <p>In a much better mental place mentally. I made a page about <a href="/06 links/nia.html">nature inspired art</a>,
        a sort of commonplace about artists and their work blending art and science and inspired by other-than-human beings. So far, there's mostly music, 
        technically of the ambient variety. I really like the genre. So that's what you're getting.</p>
    <p>I also added <a href="/03 writing/03 longform/osom.html">my first fiction short story!</a> Woohoo! 
        You have not idea for how long it's been taking space in my brain. Too long!</p>
    <p>I feel like I'm in that state where I'm letting go of things. Mental clutter is a real thing for me and having materialized those two products is so liberating. I want to keep up this momentum.
        The year is ending and because I have the habit of making a year in review, mental decluttering has been unconsciously rising as a priority. </p>
    <p>To close this update, I'm trying to up my book annotation game and looking for sticky tabs. 
        When social media starts showing kind of the same trending content and it looks similar, I feel like that's the stopping point and it's time to look over all the information and make choices.
        Unfortunately, I couldn't find an "environmentally-friendly" option of these tabs so I'll go by accessibility and at least support my local bookstore who carry this item.</p>
    <h2>November 15th, 2024</h2>
        <p>Where did October go?! It feels like I'm catching up with life and the lack of motivation and excitement has doubled.</p>
        <p>I feel like what I want to do is so alien to my responsibilities as a students that I cannot force any effort on coursework.</p>
        <p>I'm just in that stage of my life where I know what I want to do and putting effort into anything else feels like a complete waste of time. Sorry for the venting. This is such an odd state of mind to be. I'll keep myself in check.</p>
        <p>As for the site, because I have been reading and writing these past couple of days, I will focus on adding written content in the Writing section.
            For starters, I will share some book notes from Scum Villain's Self-Saving System. I read the unofficial version before the official English release and got my hands on the first two volumes.
            I want to dissect this story because it's one of my favorite stories from the author. </p>
    <h2>October 28th, 2024</h2>
    <p>Decided to take the site's ethos to a more minimalistic, writting-centered approach. 
        I'm working on a new layout with light and dark modes. </p>
        
    <h2>October 19, 2024</h2>
    <p>This past couple of weeks have been <i>hectic.</i>From a 180 change in environment to the looming end to this mock vacation, I don't know what's going on anymore.</p>
    <p>It's been great though! Cohost is gone and I made this website which feels like a natural development of my growing interest in the indie web. 
        I want to get better at front-end web development because it aligns with my professional goals and values, and I wanted to create a space to share my creative hobbies.</p>
