            <h2>November 25th, 2024</h2>
            <p>Where did October go?! It feels like I'm catching up with life and the lack of motivation and excitement has doubled.</p>
            <p>I feel like what I want to do is so alien to my responsibilities as a students that I cannot force any effort on coursework.</p>
            <p>I'm just in that stage of my life where I know what I want to do and putting effort into anything else feels like a complete waste of time. Sorry for the venting. This is such an odd state of mind to be. I'll keep myself in check.</p>
            <p>As for the site, because I have been reading and writing these past couple of days, I will focus on adding written content in the Writing section.
                For starters, I will share some book notes from Scum Villain's Self-Saving System. I read the unofficial version before the official English release and got my hands on the first two volumes.
                I want to dissect this story because it's one of my favorite stories from the author. 
            </p>
            <h2>October 28th, 2024</h2>
    <p>Decided to take the site's ethos to a more minimalistic, writting-centered approach. 
            I'm working on a new layout with light and dark modes. </p>
        
    <h2>October 19, 2024</h2>
    <p>This past couple of weeks have been <i>hectic.</i>From a 180 change in environment to the looming end to this mock vacation, I don't know what's going on anymore.</p>
    <p>It's been great though! Cohost is gone and I made this website which feels like a natural development of my growing interest in the indie web. 
        I want to get better at front-end web development because it aligns with my professional goals and values, and I wanted to create a space to share my creative hobbies.</p>
