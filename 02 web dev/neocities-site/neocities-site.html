        <h3>November 16th, 2024</h3>
        <p>Refocusing my efforts in writing and making that available in <a href="/03 writing/writing.html">here</a>.
            New <a href="/01 now/now.html">Now</a> entry.
            <a href="/06 links/links.html">Links</a> page is now available. It has buttons leading to other sites and a single webring I managed to apply to.
        </p>
        <h3>October 30th, 2024</h3>
        <p>Finished updating the whole website with the new layout. 
            Checked off a bunch of items from my <a href="/02 web dev/webdev-commonplace.html">site plans</a> such as a site updates log (you're here!), a site map (see footer), using a minimalist layout, introducing iframes, and an accessibility statement (see footer).</p>
        <p>Two important items left for accessibility are <u>adding alt text to images</u>  and seeing whether to <u>add an option to manually change to
        dark mode.</u>
        <p>Welp, I had some free time added alt text and tested the dark mode. I'll keep the latter in the background for now.
            I also updated the <a href="/02 web dev/webdev-commonplace.html">commonplace notebook with more sites and resources.</a></p>
        <p>Next might be setting up a guestbook and a links page.</p>
        </p>

        <h3>October 28th, 2024</h3>
        <p>I finished what I consider the version 0 of this site two weeks ago. 
            I took a week off probably due to burnout and shiny new thing syndrome.</p>
        <p>Today I'm back and highly-motivated.
            My main objective was to made another version of the homepage in a more minimalist style.
            A secondary objective was to decide on color schemes for light mode and mode. Both objectives were accomplished.
            The site is very blue.</p>
        <p>Next, I would like to add a button to switch between these modes but I should test without it myself and see whether it's really necessary.
