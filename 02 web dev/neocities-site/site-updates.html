        <h3>December 16th, 2024</h3>
        <p>MASSIVE update! <a href="/04 crafts/crafts.html">Crafts</a> and <a href="https://maryseph.atabook.org/">Guestbook</a> in the nav bar are now available. 
            With this, all items in the nav now lead to somewhere! In the crafts page, I added some WIPs. The guestbook is made with atabook.org.
            I also added a visitor counter, a clap button, and two stickers to the main page. 
            Last but not least, I resized the iframe this page shows in the main page and styled the scrollbar.</p>
