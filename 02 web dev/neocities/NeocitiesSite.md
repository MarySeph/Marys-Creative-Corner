A page to highlight some elements of this site on the web dev side.

## Site Plans
- choose a site favicon for site and add designer name to [[Credits]].
- a manifesto for the site's ethos.
- Might want to dabble more into responsive web design and use relative sizes according to screen size.
- Character profiles! Keima, Kiyoshi for starters.
- Create page for Historical-fiction story and the HSP-isekai one.
- Edit and publish Tadashi and Dashi's story
- Listfaugraphy page with all sorts of resources (or just add hotkeys to smoothen addition of HTML tags, idk)
- HSP/self care resources: Ambience music, Meditation (link to Medito), ASMR, etc.
- Website Button!
