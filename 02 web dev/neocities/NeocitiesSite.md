A page to highlight some elements of this site on the web dev side.

## Site Plans

- Character profiles! Keima, Kiyoshi for starters.
- Create page for Historical-fiction story and the HSP-isekai one.
- Edit and publish Tadashi and Dashi's story
- Listfaugraphy page with all sorts of resources (or just add hotkeys to smoothen addition of HTML tags, idk)
- HSP/self care resources: Ambience music, Meditation (link to Medito), ASMR, etc.
- Website Button!
- ~~add [ghost garden's](https://ghostgarden.neocities.org/) TOC style to some pages.~~
- ~~[[NeocitiesSite#<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>]] section~~
- ~~Clap and access counters~~
