MASSIVE update! [[Crafts]] and [Guestbook](https://maryseph.atabook.org/) in the nav bar are now available. With this, all items in the nav now lead to somewhere! In the crafts page, I added some WIPs. The guestbook is made with atabook.org. I also added a visitor counter, a clap button, and two stickers to the main page. Last but not least, I resized the iframe this page shows in the main page and styled the scrollbar.
