<h2>Volume 1</h2>
<h3>Chapter 5: Bai Lu</h3>
<h4>Post-Binghe Banishment (pg.290)</h4>
<p>As Shen Qing Qiu and Shang Qing Hua sought the Sun Dew mushroom, SQH inquired about Cucumber's thoughts on Luo Binghe
because he had heard of SQQ being "inconsolably heartbroken" and witnessed it with his own two eyes. SQH mentions that
while Cucumber-bro roasted many of characters, LBH was spared. SQQ interpreted the inquiry as girls talk and avoided the
question, hoho. Putting myself in SQQ's shoes, I wouldn't have said anything either. That seemly judgmental tone of SQH
describing SQQ's actions like "Time after time, you call Luo Binghe's name, and you stand in front of that sword mound
and sigh in sorrow. Cucumber-bro, I really never thought you were this sort of person." SO embarrassing. WHO WOULD HAVE
ADDMITED IT?!</p>
<br>

<h2>Volume 2</h2>
<h3>Chapter 6: Jin Lan</h3>
<h4>On Luo Binghe's Return (pg. 40)</h4>
<p>Volume 2 starts with a three year timeskip. We learn that Luo Binghe has returned two years early from the Endless Abyss
from the proposed five years in the original novel. Plus, in the past year, he took Gongyi Xiao's place as head
disciple. So, in fact, it took two years for Binghe to leave the abyss, 2/5 from the original or reduced his time by
60%. DAMN. I don't know if it was through the power of love or angst.</p>
<br>

<h4>Scared but Horny (pg. 50)</h4>
<p>I think it's fucking hilarious that SQQ got thrown against the wall, felt pain, and thought Binghe looked "peerlessly
beautiful" under the moonlight. BRUH! That was such a scared but horny scene. "He pressed very close, and he spoke with
slow deliberation." Binghe's yandere phase is truly one of a kind.</p>
<br>

<h4>LBH Is Angry (pg. 54-55)</h4>
<p>Man, these two pages are so heartbreaking. LBH believes his Shizun hates him because he's part demon (which is a MASSIVE
misunderstanding) and is accusing him of every terrible thing that has happened in the city (ie. the plague). In other
words, Binghe believes that SQQ is like everyone else in the mortal realm with a bias against the demon race, or, a
racist. Kind of interesting such a topic being touched in a story like this. Back to the pain though, SQQ in fact
DOESN'T have any bias against demons. His bias stems from PIDW's Bing-ge (OG LBH) and there's no way SQQ is confessing
THAT whole thing. Nevertheless, LBH's misunderstand causes him more confusion of SQQ's past actions because he strictly
said that Binghe shouldn't "put too much weight on race" and that "no one is intolerable to the heaves." And he's SO SO
mad to SQQ because he seems like a hypocrite and it breaks my heart! I just can't stand someone displaying anger when
there's so much pain underneath.</p>
