# 2024 Scrappy Crochet Christmas Presents
Start date: 12/14/2024; End date: [MM/DD/YYYY].

This project will be different from others where I drop a bunch of information about small projects. I want to use my yarn scraps for small Christmas presents this year and I would love to document and share this! I have bought a lot of yarn this year and I'm actively holding myself back from buying more and using up what I have.

I'm working with a limited number of yarn balls I chose to bring beforehand. I have some color schemes in mind but if a color runs out, they may be paired with something that looks a little off.

### Notes:
I love making small items with cotton yarn. I think there's something lovely about getting a handmade every day item. I like to make handtowels, dishtowels, and scrubbies, and other household items.

I had this video pattern saved for a long time and I wanted to change the bath sponge I used so I decided to make a test for myself and make more as gifts.

In general, I tried to keep the yarn on the weight 4 category. This an all other projects will be made with cotton yarn.
