# Site Manifesto

This site was created after a previous attempt using TiddlyWiki. With some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS and some research on static website hosting platforms, staring October 2024 this site is being hosted on Neocities.

There are three promises I will make to you, dear reader, regarding this site.

1. Accessibility

I promise that, to the best of my ability, to make this site as accessible as possible, [these are the guidelines I will follow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). Which level of standard to uphold is pending.

When I'm developing this site, I'm keeping low-vision readers, those with motion sensitivity, and mobile users in mind. Thus, I will refrain, at ANY point, from using blinkies, low-contrast images, and excessive gifs. I'm part of those audiences so, haha, I gotta start somewhere!

2. Mobile-first
3.
